                <P>Hello, my name is <strong>Illan Sempere</strong>. I just moved from France a year and a half ago.
                </P>
                <p>I then graduated from <em>Sir Winston Churchill</em> secondary school last June which happened under
                    interesting circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>I decided to join the CIT program at BCIT because I have always been intrigued by computers and the
                    internet in general
                </p>
                <p>Iâ€™m not sure of what I want to do after the CIT program but I think that I will go into
                    cybersecurity and do another two year program before finishing school. </P>
