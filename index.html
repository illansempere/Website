                <P>Hello, my name is <strong>Illan Sempere</strong>. I just moved from France a year and a half ago.
                    <a href="https://www.bcit.ca" title="BCIT website"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/BCIT_logo.svg" alt="Bcit Logo"
                    width=150" height="136" style="float:right"></a>
                    <br>
                    I then graduated from <em>Sir Winston Churchill</em> secondary school last June which happened under
                    interesting circumstances. <br>
                    I decided to join the CIT program at BCIT because I have always been intrigued by computers and the
                    internet in general.<br>
                    Iâ€™m not sure of what I want to do after the CIT program but I think that I will go into
                    cybersecurity and do another two year program before finishing school. </P>
