    <h1>Lab 2</h1>
    <h2>My introduction</h2>

    <P>Hello, my name is <strong>Illan Sempere</strong>. I just moved from France a year and a half ago. <br>
        I then graduated from <em>Sir Winston Churchill</em> secondary school last June which happened under interesting circumstances. <br>
        I decided to join the CIT program at BCIT because I have always been intrigued by computers and the internet in general. <br>
        Iâ€™m not sure of what I want to do after the CIT program but I think that I will go into cybersecurity and do another two year program before finishing school. </P>
    
    <p>I have a total of 7 courses.
        Here are 3 courses which I am taking: <br>
        <ul>
            <li> <a title="about" href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/20203041869">ACIT-1515 - Scripting for IT</a> <br></li>
            <li>COMM-1116 - Business Communications</li>
            <li>ACIT-1630 - Database Systems</li>
          </ul>
    </p>
